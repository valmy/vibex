## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Web Framework | FastAPI | Specified in REQUIREMENTS.md, modern, async-first |
| Dependency Manager | uv | Specified in REQUIREMENTS.md, fast, modern |
| Database | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB | Recommended in REQUIREMENTS.md, time-series optimized |
| Container Runtime | Podman | Explicitly requested, better security |
| Logging | Python logging + JSON | Standard library, structured output |
| Architecture | Monorepo | Supports future frontend integration |
| API Design | REST + WebSocket | Real-time updates for frontend |
| Multi-Account | Supported from start | Required by REQUIREMENTS.md |

---

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 1-2 days | Foundation (config, logging, structure) | Ready |
| 2 | 1-2 days | Infrastructure (Podman, dependencies) | Blocked |
| 3 | 2-3 days | FastAPI skeleton (app, DB, API) | Blocked |
| 4 | 3-5 days | Core services (trading, market data) | Blocked |
| 5 | 2-3 days | Testing & deployment | Blocked |
| **Total** | **9-15 days** | **Complete application** | **Planning** |

---

## Configuration Strategy

### Environment Variables
- Required: API keys, database URL
- Optional: API host/port, trading parameters
- Multi-account support via account-specific variables

### Configuration Classes
- BaseConfig (common)
- DevelopmentConfig (debug enabled)
- TestingConfig (in-memory DB)
- ProductionConfig (optimized)

### Secrets Management
- All secrets in environment variables
- .env.local for local overrides
- No secrets in code

---

## Logging Architecture

### Framework
Python's built-in logging with JSON formatting

### Log Files
- app.log (general)
- trading.log (trading operations)
- market_data.log (market data)
- llm.log (LLM interactions)
- errors.log (errors only)

### Features
- Structured JSON output
- Log rotation (100MB per file)
- Sensitive data masking
- Environment-based log levels

---

## API Endpoints

### REST Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /status` - System status
- `GET /diary` - Trading diary
- `GET /positions` - Current positions
- `GET /performance` - Performance metrics
- `GET /accounts` - Account management
- `GET /docs` - OpenAPI documentation

### WebSocket Endpoints
- `/ws/trading-events` - Trading decisions
- `/ws/market-data` - Market data
- `/ws/positions` - Position updates

---

## Clarifications Needed

8 decisions require stakeholder input:

1. **Frontend Framework**: React, Vue, or Svelte?
2. **Backup Strategy**: Local, cloud, or managed?
3. **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana or cloud?
4. **Log Aggregation**: ELK, cloud, or local?
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions or other?
6. **Authentication**: API key, JWT, or OAuth2?
7. **Rate Limiting**: Simple or advanced?
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation or restart?
