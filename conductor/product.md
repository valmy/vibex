## Target Users
*   **Individual Cryptocurrency Traders**: Retail traders looking for automated AI assistance to enhance their trading performance.
*   **Quantitative Developers**: Developers seeking a modular and extensible framework for building and deploying AI-driven trading agents.

## Core Goals
*   **Minimal Intervention Automation**: Deliver a trading bot capable of fully autonomous operation with high reliability.
*   **Transparent Decision-Making**: Provide a "glass box" experience where every trade rationale is logged and auditable by the user.
*   **Extensible Framework**: Enable developers to easily integrate custom strategies, technical indicators, and market data sources.

## MVP Features

*   **AI-Driven Market Analysis**: Leverage LLMs via OpenRouter to analyze market sentiment and technical data for trade generation.

## Risk Management Approach
*   **Dynamic AI-Calculated Risk**: Risk parameters (leverage, position sizing) are dynamically determined by the LLM based on market volatility and internal confidence scores.

## Resilience and Volatility Handling
*   **AI-Driven Market Vibe Assessment**: The LLM continuously assesses the "market vibe" to detect anomalies, automatically scaling down exposure or halting trading during periods of irrational volatility.
